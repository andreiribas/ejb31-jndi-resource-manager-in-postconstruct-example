ejb31-jndi-resource-manager-in-postconstruct-example
====================================================

This application is an example of question enthuware.oce-ejbd.v6.2.582 :, from enthuware's for Oracle Certified Expert - Enterprise JavaBeans Developer 6 exam simulator:

In Enthuware's anwer to this question, it said that A stateless session bean cannot access resource managers in @PostConstruct or @PreDestroy methods.

I created an example trying to do that, and it worked.

In this project, there is a singleton, Main. It gets a reference of ResourceDependencyFinderBean class, which is a stateless session bean.
In this class @PostConstruct method, it uses JNDI to get a reference to the ResourceDependencyFinderBeanV2, which is another stateless session bean.

According to Enthuware's answer, this should not work, but it does.

You can also run the unit tests on Eclipse, the result is the same.
